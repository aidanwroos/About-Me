Hi! My name is Aidan.

I'm a second year student at Oregon State studying Computer Science. I aspire to pursue a career in Software Engineering.

Here are two things you should know about me:

1. Challenges excite and motivate me. I love any opportunity to problem solve and brainstorm creative solutions.
2. I enjoy working with and helping others, because I strive to learn new perspectives and exchange knowledge.
